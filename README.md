# RNN_SentimentAnalysis
The objective of this assignment is to develop and implement a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using TensorFlow for sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset. The goal is to train the RNN to accurately classify movie reviews as either positive or negative based on the textual content. The assignment involves loading and preprocessing the dataset, building and training the RNN model, evaluating its performance using appropriate metrics, performing hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model, and conducting a comparative analysis with an alternative neural network architecture. Through this process, we will gain a comprehensive understanding of RNNs and their application in natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis.
